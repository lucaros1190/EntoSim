# EntoSim v2.1

### Introduction

EntoSim is a software that fit with the idea of a fast application of mathematical models to study ectotherm populations like insects.
It is developed to manage directly all the calculation needed from a first step of lab rearing parameters estimation, to a second step of field population modelling, and finally ending up to a comparison and model validation.  	
All these mathematical operations and analyses are combined in a single software, with the possibility to easily add other population dynamics models, as well as other development rate functions.

### What is new

We are proud to annouce that the realeas of a new version of EntoSim!
You can now visualize your simulations on your local browsers just by running the EntoSim Docker container without any further installation.
